    "1. **Create a GitHub Personal Access Token:**\n",
    "    Go to your GitHub account settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic).\n",
    "    Generate a new token with the required permissions (repo access, issues, pull requests, etc.).\n",
    "2. **Create a Google API Personal Access Token:**\n",
    "3. **Set the Tokens in Your Secret key**\n",
    "4. **Run the Agent Using Default Prompts:**\n",
    "    Use the pre-defined prompts to interact with the agent, such as listing issues, creating branches, or opening pull requests.\n",
    "    The agent will automatically use the tools provided to perform actions on your repository.\n",
